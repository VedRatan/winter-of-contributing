First of all a method is a set of codes that are grouped together to perform a certain task or we can say operation.

So, basically there are two types of methods in java :-
1.) Predefined Methods.
2.) User-defined Methods.

1.) PREDEFINED METHODS:
These type of methods are already defines for us in java libraries, also known as standard library or built-in methods, there is no need to define them, we can directly use them
at any point of code. ex: compareTo(), length(), sqrt() etc.

let's have a look at the code snippet which will make you more clear about predefined methods:

import java.util.*;
class example
{
  public static void main(Strings args[]) throws IOException
  {
    System.out.println("the square root of 144 is :"+Math.sqrt(144));
  }
}

In the above exmple we're having main(), println(), sqrt() functions, which we've used directly without defining them.

2.) USER-DEFINED METHODS:
These type of methods are defined by users according to their need, and also they can modify them according to their requirements.

let's have a look at the code snippet which will make you more clear about user-defined methods:

import java.util.*;
class example_of_user_defined
{
    public static void sum(int a, int b)
{
     System.out.println("Sum is: "+(a+b));   
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
    sum(9,10);
}
}

In the above example as soon as the compiler reaches at sum() function the control transfer to the function.

Congraulations! you've got the basic knowledge of types of functions in java, keep learning, keep coding, and also keep exploring üòÅüòÅ.
